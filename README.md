# cse210-student-template
This is the starter code for students in CSE 210.

This repository contains the starter code for many different projects. They are arranged as follows:

* `sandbox` - An empty project that you can use to play around with any concepts you like.
* `csharp-prep` - Starter projects for each of the C# Prep assignments.
* `prepare` - Starter projects for each of the preparation Learning Activities.
* `prove` - Starter projects for each of the prove Developer projects.
* `final` - Starter projects for final project.

I'm not exactly sure what the staging area is. I'm assuming that I just need to make some kind of change to this repository and then reupload it? 
Here's to hoping. 
I made changes and pushed the information, but it's not showing at all in my github.

I found my error! I had to close the commit tab to allow the git push command to work!
